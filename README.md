# memorizer

I guess a lot of us having a hard time remembering new words in an unknow language.
Or remembering quick fixes to certain problems that we face too often. 

**I remember googling "how to center a div inside a div" over 10 times during my programming career.**

We are forgetting easily.

To prevent that I developed an app for personal use based on this idea:

[Spaced Repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition)

The app simply asks you the key value pairs with notifications, with intervals that is determined by spaced repetetion theory.


There are 3 steps to memorize something forever:

1. Create new key value pair.

2.When notifications come (there are over 20 notification for one entry, from minute 1 and to 6 months), try to remember the value before looking up the solution.

3. Check if you are right.

The spaces between notifications are estimated from the wiki page.
